# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Key Learnings

#### Terraform Backend

 - Terraform remote backend cannot be configured    directly on the first run if the resources are not available already. 

    Two ways to configure the Terraform remote Backend

    ##### Option 1
    Create resources manually and then create the terraform remote backend. 
    ##### Option 2
    Create the resources using terraform apply wihtout specifying backend configuration and create a storage account container which stores the tfstate and then add the backend configuration in main.tf and perform `terraform init -migrate-state`

- Terraform backend configuration block cannot contain variables. You have to use hardcoded values or use terragrunt it provides a thin wrapper

- In Terraform, the term "workspace" can refer to different contexts, but in this case, it seems to refer to the current working directory where Terraform commands are executed. When you run terraform plan or terraform apply, Terraform operates within the directory where these commands are executed, and it cannot access files outside of this directory using relative paths like work.

#### Terraform Clean

- There is no command like `terraform clean`. Use following commands to achieve the same

    * `rm -f terraform.tfstate terraform.tfstate.backup`
    * `rm -rf .terraform`
    * `rm -f plan.out`
    * Remove Terraform generated configuration files
